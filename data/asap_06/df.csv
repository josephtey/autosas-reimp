16325,6,0,,"1. They have special receptors that only allow certain things to come into the cell. 2. Most cells contain a nucleus, which is like a brain, that controls what needs to be done. The nucleus also controls the ER which exports protiens. So only the bad stuff gets transported out of the cell. 3. Cells have special enzymes that allow them to take in material that may be too big to fit into a receptor. This allows them to take in important things that would not be allowed in otherwise.",test
