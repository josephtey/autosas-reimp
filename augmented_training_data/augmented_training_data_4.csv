As the text says pandas eat ""almost nothing but bamboo"" and the koala ""eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" On the other hand, pythons are classified as a generalist species, able to live in a wider range of habitats and live off of a wider range of food sources , whether in Asia of the U.S. The main difference here is ability to survive in our quickly changing world: the generalists (python) hold a huge advantage over the specialists (panda and koala.)",train,"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia in that they are both specialist species, meaning they need very specific conditions, climate and habitat to flourish.

12467,4,0,0,"After mRNA leaves the nucleus, after going through the process of trancription where the RNA polymerase unzip the strand into two identical halves, the mRNA goes to the ribosome. Translation occurs when tRNA makes a copy of the DNA segment and complementary base pairs are linked to the half of the mRNA strand. The complementary base pairs start to link onto the mRNA strand only when the start codon is identify and complemented. Then the tRNA brings amino acids and builds the amino acids onto the molecule making a protein chain. Finally the base pairs hit the stop codon and translation has completed the new mRNA strand.",train,"After mRNA leaves the nucleus, after going through the process of trancription where the RNA polymerase unzip the strand into two identical halves, the mRNA goes to the ribosome.
